# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Creating Databases with SQL (Postgres)

## Overview:
In this challenge we were given the task to use SQL to find out which employees were retiring so that the company Pewlett-Hackard can plan accordingly. We used SQL to create relations between different tables in order to find out the retirees of each department and which retirees qualify for the mentorship program. 

## Purpose:
The purpose of this challenge is to develop our relational database skill set by having us create queries in SQL. In SQL we can create tables and relate them to one another to develop a relationship that we can analyze. 

## Resources
* Data Source: (departments, employees, dept_emp, dept_manager, salaries, titles).csv
* Software PostgreSQL 13.3. 


Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
